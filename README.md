1. Run main.py if you want to input start_state and end_state and it will return best_first_search and A*_search Results.
   Output will be saved in output.txt and will not be stored in terminal since output.txt will be easier to view and we can't read more that 100 lines from terminal

    Go through comments in file
    Uncomment start_state and goal_state line(2&3) in first and function calling lines in last
    and then run
